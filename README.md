# Offlinifyer

---

This lightweight Chrome extension is used to make websites accessible offline.

Creating this with the intention of allowing study resources to be accessible on trains, on internet-poor areas, remote corners of the earth.

## Running this extension

1. Clone this repository.
2. Load this directory in Chrome as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked).
3. Pin the extension to the browser's taskbar and click on the action button to save it to your downloads folder.

### CAUTION!
Asynchronization has been used at many steps of the Offlinifiying process to speed it up, so ***choose a filter wisely***! There is currently *no* failsafe for the extension!

### In case of emergencies (my go to)
Remove the extension, close the window to remove all tabs

## Using the Offline Website
Simply index.html in your browser.

## About the repo
Most of the logic is can be found under [scripts/offlinifying.js](https://github.com/zlumi/Offlinify/blob/main/scripts/offlinifying.js). It is the only documented file for this reason.
